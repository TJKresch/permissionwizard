    <h4> How it works: </h4>
    <p>
      Users can run reports here on the tools and data that they already have access to on a different tool.  For example, giving your Superintendent Read Only access or above on the Reports tab will allow him to run reports on the other tools he has access to (like the daily log to see his manpower totals).

    <h4>Our Recommendation:</h4>
    <p>
      Anyone who you would not mind reporting off of the data that they already have access to should be a Read Only or a Standard level user.  There is no difference between the two.
