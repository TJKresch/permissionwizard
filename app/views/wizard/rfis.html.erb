    <h4> How it works: </h4>
    <p>
      Standard level users can create RFIs, but they can only assign them "upstream" to an Admin.  Admins can assign RFIs to both Standards and other Admins.  This allows them to "re-route" RFIs to the appropriate location.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ex: A subcontractor might be a "Standard" level user and an architect might also be a "Standard".  We don't want them assigning items directly to one another, so the Subcontractor must assign the RFI to the Project Manager first (an Admin) who reviews it, then re-assigns it to the Architect.

    <h4>Our Recommendation:</h4>
    <p>
      Anyone who should be able to create RFIs or who will ever be responding to an RFI should be a Standard.  (Usually Superintendents, Architects/Engineers, Consultants, Owners, and sometimes Subcontractors).  Make sure to set at least template as an "Admin" on the tool, or else your Standard level users will have no one to assign their RFIs to.
