    <h4> How it works: </h4>
    <p>
      Change orders can be assigned to a Designated Reviewer who will have the power to Approve the change order. This could be an Owner for a Prime Contract Change Order or a Subcontractor for a Subcontract Change Order.  Users must have at least "Standard" access to be a Designated Reviewer.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Change orders are created and assigned in either the Prime Contract Tool or the Commitments Tool, but the Change Orders tool where the Designated Approver can approve the Change Orders, even if they do not have access to the contract it belongs to.

    <h4>Our Recommendation:</h4>
    <p>
      Any non-Admin who will be approving a Change Order should have "Standard" permission here. "Read Only" is not a useful permission level*.  Eveyone else should be "None".
    </p>
    <p>
      *  Anyone below an Admin will only see a Change Order if they are the Designated Approver and "Read Only" users can not be Approvers in Procore.
