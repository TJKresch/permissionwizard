    <h4> How it works: </h4>
    <p>
      Everything under the Commitments tool is "Private by Default," meaning that even Read Only and Standard level users will not see anything on a contract unless you specifically add those users to the permission settings under the "General" subtab of the specific contract.  You must be an Admin to create or modify Contracts or to create any Change Orders or track Payments Issued against the contract.  Standard level users can create draw requests against a contract if they already have access to that contract.

    <h4>Our Recommendation:</h4>
    <p>
      Your contract administrators and full project admins should be "Admin" here.  Other users who should be able to see a specific contract should be "Standard" if you want them to be able to create draw requests against the contract or "Read Only" if you only want them to view the contract.  Everyone else should have "None" access. 
    </p>
    <p>
      * Any Read Only or Standard users must be specifically included on the privacy settings of a contract to see it.
